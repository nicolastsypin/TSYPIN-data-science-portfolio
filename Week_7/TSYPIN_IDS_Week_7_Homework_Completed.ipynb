This number doesn't actually tell us that much in a vacuum because different fields are differently stringent and sometimes people are looking for causation more than correlation. However, with the amount of seemingly variables we have, this does seem kind of low and I am inclined to think it is not a great model.\n",

Both these variables have a positive impact on the median house value, while the average amount of rooms feature has the largest negative effect while also being less in magnitude. The latitude and longitude values seem to indicate that location has an impact on the median house value but it may be more difficult to interpret intuitively. \n",

This is around 1/7 of the range and almost 60% of the standard deviation. Overall, this means that the model is not trustworthy enough to give you a close prediction of the target variable. Some more context may be needed about the feature variables, but with this and a R^2 of 0.61, it does not seem that our model matches very well."

Besides the location values, the next highest magnitude was AveRooms but I didn't want to include this because I think it may covary significantly with AveBedrms and may not tell us that much.

In terms of the coefficients, a very interesting observation is that the MedInc coefficient is virtually the exact same, perhaps showing it is truly related to the target variable in this way.

I would not use this model in practice because I chose the variables based on prior coefficients and intuition and there are better ways to determine relevant variables to a model. I think it doesn't really do a better job at predicting the target variable or explaining relationships than the first model.
