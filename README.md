# Nicolas Tsypin's Data Science Portfolio

## Hi! 

This is my **personal portfolio of data science** skills I will acquire and solidify through my ***MDSC 200009 Intro to Data Science*** course with David Smiley. I hope for it to become a clear showcase of my ability while also being a resource for myself to use in the future.

### Plans for Expansion
I aim for my portfolio to be organized for future projects with folders for raw data files, data analysis, data visualization, and models. 
I want my files to be clearly named in both content and timestamp and may group projects and assignments based on similar content and/or themes. üóÇÔ∏è
