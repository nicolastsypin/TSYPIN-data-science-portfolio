# Nicolas Tsypin's Data Science Portfolio

## Hi! 

This is my **personal portfolio of data science** skills I will acquire and solidify through my ***MDSC 200009 Intro to Data Science*** course with David Smiley. I hope for it to become a clear showcase of my ability while also being a resource for myself to use in the future.

## Projects

[My attempt at a basic Streamlit app](https://github.com/nicolastsypin/TSYPIN-data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Portfolio-Updates/basic_streamlit_app)   

This project looks at a dataset with penguins and makes a very basic streamlit app to look at the data. It is a good way for me to be able to make interactive visuals for telling data stories.


[My Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/nicolastsypin/TSYPIN-data-science-portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)

This project looks at the Mutant Moneyball dataset and tidies it up for data visualization. This is vital for my data science skills because cleaning up messy datasets is a key part of data analysis and makes me better equipped for data tasks. This project demonstrates my grasp of these concepts in one place. 


[My Machine Learning Streamlit App](https://github.com/nicolastsypin/TSYPIN-data-science-portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp)

This project looks at two machine learning classifier models (Decision Trees and K Nearest Neighbor) and allows users to upload a dataset and finetune hyperparameters. This was a really cool project because it gave me great practice making a usable Streamlit app and also forced me to review and make sure I understood these two models really well. Doing this in the Streamlit framework also gives me experience deploying apps and creating something interactive and hopefully fun/easy to use for others. 

[My Unsupervised Machine Learning App](https://github.com/nicolastsypin/TSYPIN-data-science-portfolio/tree/main/MLUnsupervisedApp)

This project is similar to my supervised learning app, but extends it to the exciting world of unsupervised learning. The app allows users to upload a dataset and train a k-means clustering model visualized by a PCA plot. The app also provides performance metrics for helping the user decide on what k to use. This app was very useful in solidifying my Streamlit skills and working with my knowledge of unsupervised learning. Hopefully, it can also be helpful for others, whether fellow students or fledgling data scientists.
