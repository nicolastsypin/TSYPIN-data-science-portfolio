# Nicolas Tsypin's Data Science Portfolio

## Hi! 

This is my **personal portfolio of data science** skills I will acquire and solidify through my ***MDSC 200009 Intro to Data Science*** course with David Smiley. I hope for it to become a clear showcase of my ability while also being a resource for myself to use in the future.

## Projects

[My attempt at a basic Streamlit app](https://github.com/nicolastsypin/TSYPIN-data-science-portfolio/tree/main/basic_streamlit_app)   

This project looks at a dataset with penguins and makes a very basic streamlit app to look at the data. It is a good way for me to be able to make interactive visuals for telling data stories.


[My Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/nicolastsypin/TSYPIN-data-science-portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)

This project looks at the Mutant Moneyball dataset and tidies it up for data visuzalization. This is vital for my data science skills because cleaning up messy datasets is a key part of data analysis and makes me better equipped for data tasks. This project demonstrates my grasp of these concepts in one place.
