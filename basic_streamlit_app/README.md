## This is a basic Streamlit app through which I will explore how to display data interactively.    
I will be using Palmer's Penguins data to practice making an interactive streamlit.   
     
When you use my streamlit app, make sure not to run it like a normal Python file but instead use "streamlit run basic_streamlit_app/main.py"!
