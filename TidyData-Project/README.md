# Welcome to my Tidy Project!

### Overview

In this project, I took the edited Mutant Moneyball dataset sourced from [here](https://github.com/EliCash82/mutantmoneyball/tree/main) and tidied the data up according to tidy data principles. These included making sure each observation was a row and that columns only provided one piece of information at a time. I then visualized the data to see some relationships over time and between sources. Tidy data principles are important for data scientists because we have to be able to manipulate data sets into easily analyzable formats and make sure table are easy to read when we tell our data stories. 

### Instructions

To run this notebook, you need to download the dataset (available in this project folder). Go through the notebook in order to manipulate variables correctly and import the necessary libraries (pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib). 

### Dataset Description

This dataset was given to me by my professor, but sourced from the earlier github page, and all data processing done by me is in the notebook.
